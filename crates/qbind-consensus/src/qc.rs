//! Quorum Certificate (QC) abstraction for consensus.
//!
//! This module provides a logical representation of a Quorum Certificate that
//! attests to a block/proposal having received votes from a quorum of validators.
//!
//! # Design Note
//!
//! This is a purely logical QC abstraction for T52. It provides:
//! - A generic `QuorumCertificate<BlockIdT>` that references a block
//! - Logical validation against a `ConsensusValidatorSet` (membership + quorum)
//!
//! No cryptographic verification is performed in this module; that will be
//! added in future tasks.
