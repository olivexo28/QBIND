//! Block state representation for HotStuff consensus.
//!
//! This module provides a minimal internal representation of blocks in the
//! HotStuff block tree. Each `BlockNode` represents a block with its
//! identifier, view, parent relationship, and justifying QC.
//!
//! # Design Note
//!
//! This is a simplified block representation for T54. It stores only the
//! minimal fields needed for HotStuff locking and commit logic:
//! - Block identifier
//! - View/round number
//! - Parent block reference
//! - Justifying QC (QC that justifies this block)
