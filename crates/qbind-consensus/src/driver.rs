//! Consensus engine driver interface.
//!
//! This module provides a thin, explicit driver interface that a node can use
//! to "run consensus". It wraps the existing HotStuff-style consensus engine
//! in a clean interface that separates:
//!
//! - Engine logic: deciding what to do based on incoming events
//! - Node logic: when to poll the network and how to apply resulting actions
//!
//! # Key Types
//!
//! - [`ConsensusEngineAction`]: Actions the engine wants the driver to perform
//! - [`ConsensusEngineDriver`]: Trait for driving a consensus engine
//! - [`HotStuffDriver`]: Thin wrapper around the HotStuff consensus state
//! - [`ValidatorContext`]: Wrapper around validator set for membership and quorum checks
