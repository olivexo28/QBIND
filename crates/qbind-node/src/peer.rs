///
/// Currently, `PeerId` is assigned locally when peers connect (inbound or outbound).
/// There is no protocol-level verification that a peer's claimed `PeerId` corresponds
/// to any specific validator. The `PeerValidatorMap` type in this crate provides
/// a placeholder for tracking the relationship between transport peers and
/// consensus-level validator identities.
