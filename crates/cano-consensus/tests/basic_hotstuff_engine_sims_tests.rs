//! Integration tests for BasicHotStuffEngine with simulation harnesses.
//!
//! These tests exercise the BasicHotStuffEngine in realistic consensus scenarios:
//! - Single-node happy path with self-voting and commits
//! - Multi-node static leader with vote propagation and commits
//! - No commit without quorum votes (validates BFT quorum requirements)
//!
//! All tests use only public exports from `cano-consensus`.
