//! Single-node consensus simulation harness.
//!
//! This module provides a minimal harness for testing and simulating
//! a single consensus node using `MockConsensusNetwork` and a driver
//! that implements `ConsensusEngineDriver`.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use cano_consensus::{MockConsensusNetwork, HotStuffDriver, HotStuffState, SingleNodeSim};
//!
//! let net = MockConsensusNetwork::<u64>::new();
//! let driver = HotStuffDriver::for_tests_permissive_validators(HotStuffState::new_at_height(1));
//! let mut sim = SingleNodeSim::new(net, driver);
//!
//! // Run a single iteration
//! sim.step_once().unwrap();
//! ```
